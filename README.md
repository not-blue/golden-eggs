# Feathers & Golden Eggs
This pack takes advantage of the chicken_lay loot table, added in Minecraft 1.21.2+, to give chickens a little more variety in their drops. Once added to a world, chickens in that world will have a 75 percent chance of laying an egg, a 24.5 percent chance of shedding a feather, or a half percent chance of laying a gold nugget. 

This pack was inspired by [voodoobeard's Chicken Shedding](https://mc.voodoobeard.com/), which gives chickens a 10 percent chance of dropping a feather.
